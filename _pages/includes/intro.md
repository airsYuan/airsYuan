# ðŸ˜Š About me
My I worked as an NLP researcher at JD AI Lab at Beijing, mentored by Dr. [Meng Chen](https://chenmengdx.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiaodong He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W5WbqgoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

Subsequently, I was involved in the development of JD.COM APP's intelligent dialogue product "Jingxiaozhi," and I also took charge of developing several LLM intelligent platforms for corporate use. I enjoy sharing AI knowledge, and you're welcome to contact me via email or through the official account "æœºå™¨æ™ºå…ƒ" on WeChat.
